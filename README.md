  ## Installation 
  The application can be cloned from GitHub. Once cloned, the user needs to ensure that all node.js related packages are installed appropriately. If not, the user needs to install the related packages including inquirer version 6.3.1.

  ## Usage 
  Once the application installed, the user can run the application using any command line interface or CLI. Using the CLI the user needs to navigate to the scripts directory and then run the command: node index.js. If there was no issue with the installation, the application will prompt the user a series of questions. Once all the questions are answered by the user, the application will generate a `html` file named `index.html` inside the `dist` directory and print the `Your One Team Profile is successfully created! Please check out the index.html` message on the screen.

  ## Contributing
